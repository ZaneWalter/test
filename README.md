# ClearSky - A fast Minecraft PE server software based on [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)
ClearSky is a fast Minecraft: Pocket Edition server software, finally back as a real FORK of [PocketMine-MP](https://github.com/pmmp/PocketMine-MP)
## Why should I use ClearSky?
#### Because our awesome, highly skilled Team is mostly focusing on making the server behave like singleplayer, whilst having high performance and clean code.
- It has most of the blocks, items and entities that pmmp doesn't have yet. See [Issue #2](https://github.com/ClearSkyTeam/PocketMine-MP/issues/2) for further information.
- The projects we sometimes clone code from are [Genisys](https://github.com/iTXTech/Genisys), [Nukkit](https://github.com/Nukkit/Nukkit) and [IM](https://github.com/ImagicalCorp/ImagicalMine) (last one is dead). Everytime we take code from other projects we reference the commit in the commit title or description! We may also just cherry-pick the commit.

### Remember: Please only use the cs-1.0 branch or a release in [releases](https://github.com/ClearSkyTeam/PocketMine-MP/releases) for production servers.
